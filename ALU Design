🧠 Project Title: Basic ALU Design in Verilog
📘 Overview
An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental building block of digital systems and processors. 
It performs arithmetic and logic operations on binary data. 
In this project, a simple ALU is designed using Verilog HDL to execute five basic operations: 
   Addition, Subtraction, Bitwise AND, Bitwise OR, and Bitwise NOT.

⚙️ ALU Operations Supported
Operation	     Opcode (sel)	     Description
Addition	     3'b000	           Adds two 4-bit binary numbers
Subtraction	   3'b001	           Subtracts second input from the first
Bitwise AND  	 3'b010    	       Performs logical AND on each bit
Bitwise OR	   3'b011	           Performs logical OR on each bit
Bitwise NOT	   3'b100	           Inverts each bit of the first input

🧮 ALU Design Details
Inputs: Two 4-bit operands (A, B) and a 3-bit selector (sel)
Output: 4-bit result (Y), with optional carry and zero flag
Behavior: Based on the selector input, a corresponding operation is performed

🧪 Testbench
The ALU was verified using a Verilog testbench, which applied various input combinations and selector values to validate each operation. 
The simulation was run using tools like Vivado.

📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the design and testing of a basic ALU in Verilog. 
It serves as a foundational block for more complex processor design and helps in understanding the internal working of arithmetic 
and logic operations in hardware.
